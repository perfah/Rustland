# Rustland
A Wayland compositor written in Rust, hence the cool name

*Update: I have decided to start from scratch with this project by replacing the deprecated backend library WLC with [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs). 
This repository has been reset for that reason, but the previous progress is still available [here](https://github.com/perfah/Rustland-old).*
