# Rustland 2.0
A Wayland compositor written in Rust, hence the cool name

*Update: I have decided to start from scratch with this project by replacing the deprecated backend library (WLC) with another library.
This repository has been reset for that reason, but the previous progress (version 1) is still available [here](https://github.com/perfah/Rustland-old).*
